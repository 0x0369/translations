# Translations
Community translations used throughout the [sensory.gg](https://sensory.gg) website and discord bot to further provide content to users in their current native language.

## How to Contribute.

Fork this repo so you have your own version to work on. Then copy the "English" folder inside "Languages", and replace the language name you are attempting to work on. Please note that language names must be case senstive in order to distrubute dynamic content.

## Honorable mentions.

- Please ensure you do not translate any languages using ai translations as it can create bad grammar mistakes. 
- Please ensure you do not edit any of the content that has a percentage (%) next to it as it is used to load dynamic contents throughout the bot & site.
- The "config.json" file is required and must be filled out properly such as: "code": "us", "name": "English".

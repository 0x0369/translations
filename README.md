## How to Contribute.

## Honorable mentions.

- Please ensure you do not translate any languages using ai translations as it can create bad grammar mistakes. 
- Please ensure you do not edit any of the content that has a brackets ({{example_here}}) in english to it as it is used to load dynamic contents throughout the bot & site.
- The "config.json" file is required and must be filled out properly such as: "code": "us", "name": "English".
